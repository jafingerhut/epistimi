\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document is a place to write up notes on background in math that
help in learning science.


\section{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}

$\reals^3$ - The set of all points in 3-dimensional space,
i.e. where each point is specified by a sequence of 3 real-valued
coordinates.

$\del$ - Called ``nabla'', and often called ``del''.  Some history of
it can be found on the Nabla Symbol page~\cite{NablaSymbol}.

$\grad f$ - Gradient of a scalar function $f: \reals^3 \rightarrow
\reals$.

$\text{grad} f$ - another way to write the gradient of $f$, $\grad f$

TODO: Any 3Blue1Brown-quality YouTube videos showing examples and
definition of gradient, divergence, and curl?  If so, give links to
them below in appropriate sections.


\subsection{Maxwell's Equations}
\label{sec:maxwellseqns}

In partial differentiatal form:

\begin{align}
  \grad \cdot \vect{E} & = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} & & \text{Gauss's Law} \label{eq:gaussE} \\
  \grad \cdot \vect{B} & = 0 & & \text{Gauss's Law for magnetism} \label{eq:gaussB} \\
  \grad \times \vect{E} & = - \frac{\partial \vect{B}}{\partial t} & & \text{Maxwell-Faraday Equation (Faraday's law of induction)} \label{eq:maxfar} \\
  \grad \times \vect{B} & = \mu_0 ( \vect{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vect{E}}{\partial t} ) & & \text{Amp\`{e}re-Maxwell law} \label{eq:ampmax}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\vect{E}$ is the electric field
  \item $\vect{B}$ is the magnetic field
  \item $\rho$ is the electric charge density
  \item $\vect{J}$ is the current density
  \item $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity
  \item $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability
\end{itemize}

Statement of the equations in English:

Gauss's Law (equation~\eqref{eq:gaussE}) says that electric fields are
``produced'' radially outward from volumes with positive electric
charge, and ``consumed'' radially into volumes with negative electric
charge.

Gauss's Law for Magnetism (equation~\eqref{eq:guassB}) says that there
are no magnetic monopoles, i.e. no sources or sinks for net magnetic
field.  All magnetic flux ``swirls around'' in loops.

\subsubsection{Questions about Maxwell's Equations}

\paragraph{Questions about Gauss's Law}

TODO: Is Gauss's Law a strict generalization of Coulomb's Law?  In
what ways?  One way is that Gauss's Law gives the electric field
generated by a distribution of charge, whereas Coulomb's Law gives the
force between two point charges.  So applying to a continuous
distribution of charge is one generalization, and what electric field
is created by that distribution of charge is another (as long as you
then combine Gauss's Law with the Lorentz force law in order to
calculate the forces).

TODO: It seems that Gauss's Law, if you take $\rho$ and $\vect{E}$ as
functions of time, gives an electric field that changes
instantaneously everywhere when the charge distribution $\rho$
changes.  There does not appear to be anything related to retarded
positions of charge in that equation anywhere.  How does the finite
speed of electric field propagation enter into Maxwell's equations?

Doing a Google search on the question ``is Gauss's law consistent with
relativistic effects'' gives answers that it {\em is} consistent with
special relativity, including the following paragraphs:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Maxwell's equations are relativistic: Gauss's law is one of Maxwell's
equations.  These equations, which describe classical
electromagnetism, are inherently Lorentz invariant.  This means they
hold true in all inertial reference frames, consistent with the
principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the
same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.
\item
Lorentz covariance: Maxwell's equations, and thus Gauss's law, can be
written in a covariant form that is explicitly consistent with Lorentz
transformations.  These transformations describe how physical
quantities change when moving from one inertial frame to another,
incorporating relativistic effects like time dilation and length
contraction.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Questions about Gauss's Law for Magnetism}

Figures for electromagnetic waves that are the propagation of light in
a vacuum show E and B fields as perpendicular to each other, and each
a sinusoid with the same phase as each other.  These figures must be
dramatic simplifications of the full E and B fields, e.g. perhaps they
show at one instant in time all E and B fields only along the line
that is the ``center'' of the rawy of light?  In particular, I am
wondering how they look in all of space, such that it is clear that
their divergence is 0 at all times, at all positions in space.  It
might be instructive to have a visual representation, perhaps an
animation, somehow showing what the E field is at all points in space
at one particular instant of time.  The B field has a very similar
shape.  And if you know what the shape of these fields are at one
instant of time, then you know that they merely ``shift'' in the
direction of light propagation over time at speed $c$, without
changing shape.


\paragraph{Is there a way to write them that has only $\rho$ without $J$?}

If one emphasizes the view that all current is due to moving charge,
is there a way to write Maxwell's equations in a way that makes this
clear?  For example, is there a way to write it with some single
function $x$ that somehow represents both $\rho$ and $J$?

I realize that it is possible to have non-zero $J$ even when $\rho$ is
a constant over time, e.g. a wire carrying a constant current in a
loop.  Here charge is moving, but the density of the charge at any one
point in space remains the same over time, because in any given
sub-volume within the wire, as much charge is entering that volume per
unit time as is leaving per unit time.

Answer from Google to this search phrase: ``are there versions of
Maxwell's equations that combine charge density and current density''

Yes, Maxwell's equations can be formulated in a way that combines
charge density and current density into a single entity called the
four-current.  This formulation is part of the covariant formulation
of electromagnetism, which is a more elegant and relativistic way to
express Maxwell's equations.

More details available on the Wikipedia page ``Covariant formulation
of classical
electromagnetism''~\cite{CovariantFormulationOfClassicalElectromagnetism}.

Since this is a four-vector, it has just as much ``information'' as
the scalar field $\rho$ plus the vector field $J$.  It makes sense
that if someone had found a way to combine $\rho$ and $J$ into a
single time-varying scalar field, they would have done so long ago.


\section{Gradient}
\label{sec:gradient}

Gradient has been generalized to many coordinate systems other than
the 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^3$, but I
will focus on $\mathbb{R}^3$.  The Wikipedia page on
Gradient~\cite{Gradient} is not too bad for me, as long as I skim over
the parts that generalize it to other coordinate systems.

Griffiths~\cite{Griffiths1998} Section 1.2.2 ``Gradient'' is good at
giving the definition and some useful examples and properties of the
gradient.  He defines $\grad T$ this way, where $\hatvec{x}$,
$\hatvec{y}$, and $\hatvec{z}$ are the unit vectors in the direction
of the three coordinate axes:
\begin{align*}
  \grad T & \equiv \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \hatvec{x}
                 + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hatvec{y}
                 + \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \hatvec{z}
\end{align*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $T : \reals^3 \rightarrow \reals$ is a scalar function that is
    continuous and differentiable
\end{itemize}
Some properties of the gradient:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\grad T(x, y, z)$ is the gradient evaluated at a position
    given by $(x, y, z)$.  The vector points in a direction that
    function $T$ increases most quickly.
  \item The function $T$ can be approximated at points $\vect{r}$ near
    $\vect{r}_0 = (x, y, z)$ by the linear function $T(\vect{r}_0) +
    (\vect{r} - \vect{r}_0) \cdot \grad T(\vect{r}_0)$
  \item The instantaneous rate of change of $T$ in direction
    $\vect{u}$ (a unit vector) from $\vect{r}_0$ is $\vect{u} \cdot
    \grad T(\vect{r}_0)$.  Note that it is always 0 in a direction
    perpendicular to $\grad T(\vect{r}_0)$, and the negative of the
    magnitude of $\grad T(\vect{r}_0)$ in the opposite direction.
  \item Consider a ``level set'', i.e. a surface defined by all of the
    points $\vect{r}$ where $T(\vect{r})=c$ for some constant $c$.
    Then $\grad T$ evaluated at any point on that surface, is normal
    to the surface.
\end{itemize}


\section{Galilean relativity}

In classical Newtonian mechanics, physical laws are invariant under
Galilean relativity, i.e. any laws that hold in one inertial frame
also hold in all other inertial frames, i.e. those that move with a
constant velocity relative to the first frame.

This applies to Newton's three laws of motion, for example.

It does not apply to measurements of quantities that depend upon
velocity, e.g. an object's momentum or kinetic energy.

However, the properties that momentum is conserved, and energy is
conserved, is preserved across inertial frames, even if the absolute
values of the kinetic energy and momentum differ between frames.

If there are forces that are velocity-dependent, e.g. a frictional
force resisting an object traveling through a medium like air or water
that is a function of velocity relative to that medium, then as long
as that force is always written as a function of the relative velocity
between the object and the medium, then note that the measurements of
such relative velocities are the same in different inertial frames.

For other examples and some mathematical derivations,
see~\cite{GalileanTransformation}.

See this video~\cite{GalileanInvarianceMaxwellsEquations} that gives a
similar mathematical demonstration that Newton's second law is
invariant under Galilean relativity, but Maxwell's equations are {\em
  not}.

  air~\cite{Fizeau1849}
